This project explores working with Python Turtle to create illustrations. In particular, the instructor will walk you through how to create a snake game. 

# Venv or Conda Installation
If your import turtle does not work we can do one of two things 

1. Install Venv ( Virtual Environment)
2. Install Conda

## Venv

Simply go on your terminal and include `pip install virtualenv`
Afterwards we will do `where python` in order to find our path 
We will include the path in our VS Code Extention 

## Conda

You must download Anaconda from
[Anaconda Link](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
This will ask you for your email and a download will be sent to your email
Simply follow the download instructions and once finished open Command Terminal
In your Command Terminal we will once again type in `where python`
This will give you your Path
We will then include path in our VS Code
